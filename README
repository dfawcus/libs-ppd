GNUstep Printer PPD Package
===========================

This package contains PPD files for various printers for use with GNUstep.
These files were originally included with the gnustep-gui package but have
now been split into a separate package, due to their large size and the
fact that they are rarely used anyway. Future versions of GNUstep will
probably use the CUPS interface, when available, and these PPD files are not
necessary with CUPS.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.
See the NEWS file for changes
